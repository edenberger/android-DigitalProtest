=== This app is an old PoC (which probably doesn't work by now) ===

Digital Protest app was made to let people protest online & worldwide.

The main idea is to generate a load together on a website, using our PCs and phones. Similar to a regular protest.

So instead of standing in the town square, your phone stand in switches, hubs and servers.
Instead of picket signs, use the Email.
Instead of megaphones, use the social media.

The app designed to send a web-request but never show the page, nor its ads.

Users can easily generate and share a "special" link with the needed information to join a protest:

http://sudfeld.io/http/www.example.com/info@example.com  

http://sudfeld.io - is so the app will recognize the link  
<ins>http</ins> - can also be https  
www.example.com - is the destination domain or IP  
<ins>info@example.com</ins> - is the destination Email address  

After a web-request has been sent the default Email app opens with the destination address already set.

Those social media protest posts with thousands of likes? can be converted to thousands of fake views, and real Emails.

These are part of the modern ways to protest
